# SKBNCyber/Will-Attendance

This branch within the SKBNCyber Repository is meant as my solution to address the accountability problem within the SKBN. SKBN has had an issue with the efficiency and accuracy of maintaining accountability for PT, Labs, and Events. In simple terms; itâ€™s annoying taking accountability.

My solution involves distributing the task of attendance to the indivisuals attending. Each type of training event would be saved as a json including location boundries, sign in time and event name. Signing into each event the user would have to be within a certain timeframe as well as GPS location withink the set boundries and their Rutgers NetID would be sent to firebase. Using firebase we can both allow for user authentication via google and compiling data in a json and parsing it for Cadre and Cadet Chain of Command purposes.

This is just a place holder readme.. until further development
